# Olivier Philippon's devblog 

After more than 20 years spent in web development without having ever
taken notes of all the "tech-wise" stuff I have in my head, its time
to ease my own cognitive overload and start taking notes :smile:

These notes are mostly for myself, for future reference - but who knows,
they might as well be useful to other people :slightly_smiling_face:
